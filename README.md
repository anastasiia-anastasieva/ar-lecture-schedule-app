# Create an AR Application "Institute"
The "Institute" Augmented Reality application is developed using the A-Frame framework and is designed to display informative text in the ETI lobby. The text informs users whether the steam system is currently operational at that location and how much time remains until it shuts down.

## System Requirements:
1. A modern web browser with WebVR support, such as Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.
2. A smartphone or computer with a webcam for augmented reality capabilities.

## Installation Instructions:
- Copy all project files to your web server or local host.
- Ensure the web server is properly configured to serve A-Frame pages.

## Usage:
1. Open the application in a supported web browser.
2. Point the camera at the AR marker (if used) to activate the display of information in the ETI lobby.
3. Information about the status of the steam system and the time until it turns off will be automatically displayed.

## Features:
- Coordinate Acquisition: The app uses GPS or other methods to determine the user's precise location in the ETI lobby.
- AR Marker Recognition: If required, the app can use an AR marker for more accurate positioning.
- Information Display: Based on the coordinates and time, the app displays text information about the operation of the steam system.
- Data Updates: Information is updated in real-time to ensure data accuracy.
